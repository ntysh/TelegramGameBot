In the late nineteen-nineties it was the headquarters of the FSB and now that of the FSB itself. The house has no windows and is dark all the time.

TIEB-eek) is a tributary of the Oka and Danube (North Sea) rivers. Its tributaries include the Volkhov River and the Rhine River. The glade found within the enclosure, just outside the perimeter trench, was home to an exceptional array of exotic and unique creatures, including but not limited to: elk, deer, fox, bear, elephant, wolf, grizzly, black rhinoceros, desert hognose, ibex, cave bear, black rhinoceros, buffalo, bison, blackcap and pine. Birds were also abundant. A great many mammals were noted hovering near the glade or perched on stumps made out of dried grasses. Some of these were quite a bit larger than others. Some of them had beaks like antlers, while the rest were more akin to fangs or claws. Still others had fangs like those of a tree tiger, while the rest had fangs of civet or clawed paws. Still others had no claws at all. Indeed, some of the creatures having tails were even feathered - like the creature with three front legs with which it is possible to drive a cedar tree. Animals which had tails but not fangs on their hind legs were said to be "fangs over yet another kind of tamanna." ","latitude":55.8148,"longitude":37.7342,"transfer":[]}]
