It is a note from a Soviet diary dated year 1988. It says: "At 18.00 (I was leaving the metro station "Biblioteka im. Lenina") I saw a demonstration of refusers-Jews. A man of forty, everything is quite calculated - posters, types of people, texts in Russian and English, but something in this group of people who courageously stood in a crowd hostile to them (however, they got used to it, no one particularly paid attention) painfully miserable. Are there any secrets or circumstances to torture people! I cried. Yes ... I have not had tears for such a long time. Tears were joyful. It means alive, the soul has not yet become hardened.
It is a story about the Dark Driver. The legend has it, that in the 1980’s a train went up in flames on the orange Kaluzhsko–Rizhskaya line. Without wasting any time, the driver of the train threw himself in the fire to save as many passengers as he could. Eventually, the man managed to get everyone out of the burning car but died later on in a hospital because of severe thermal injuries. The superiors blamed the incident on him and his supposed lack of professional qualifications. Up to this day, the enraged ghost appeared in the tunnels in search of revenge.
